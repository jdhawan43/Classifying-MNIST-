# Classifying-MNIST-
Classification MNIST using Multilayer Perceptrons.

Feedforward Neural Networks are also called artificial neural networks where the connection between different layers is only in forward direction and not in cycles. 
The information only travels forward in the network and no loops are allowed between the layers.The information first travels through the input nodes, then through the hidden nodes and finally through the output nodes. These networks are usually used for supervised learning where the outputs (also called as Labels) are given.

In this exercise, we have implemented a network with 
1 input layer
3 hidden layers( called fully connected layers) with different activation functions(Relu,Sigmoid, tanh and softmax) and 1 output layer called Softmax output layer (dependingon our loss function).
